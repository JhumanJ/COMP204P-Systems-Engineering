The entire style of the application had to be rebuilt, refactor the folder structure, the routing system, migrating redux to work on both client and server, and others... Documentaiton of next.js was really helpful.

Moreover he provided us with a Postman Collection filled with a lot of examples. Finally, when really stuck, we asked him for some help over Ryver, and he replied really quickly.

                                                    <li><b>Architecture design</b><br />
                                                    The decision to separate the front-end components from the back-end ensures that code can be easily developed for them. Instead of using the openEHR database to store all the data, the app has its own database which stores meetings, specialities and jobs, allowing better accessibility to these information.
                                                    </li><br /><li><b>UI design and UX</b><br />
                                                    The current UI design of the app is the product of several iterations and feedback from our client. We made sure that our design was sleek and simplistic while also providing visibility to the users. The implementation of the Loader and spinners to indicate that data is being loaded, combined with the Sidebar to indicate which tab the user is currently in, aims to provide the best UX for the users.
                                                    </li><br /><li><b>Functionality</b><br />
                                                    Overall, the app successfully delivers in terms of easing the process from referring the patient to assigning the patient to a meeting, to finally assigning the patient to a doctor.
                                                    It also fulfils some additional requirements like a search bar that searches through the patients from the database.
                                                    </li><br /><li><b>Stability</b><br />
                                                    The app does not undergo crashes, which is important considering it’s a medical application. Several precautions were made to ensure the database doesn’t overload, or that the app does not flood the databases with multiple HTTP requests at a time.
                                                    </li><br /><li><b>Efficiency</b><br />
                                                    In terms of efficiency, information from the local database and openEHR were retrieved in a short period of time, allowing users to acquire patients’ data quickly. In addition to that, the pages load without delay, providing users with a smoother experience while using the app.
                                                    </li><br /><li><b>Compatibility</b><br />
                                                    This app is built such that it is cross-browser, making it accessible from most internet browsers. The design was also made responsive to provide better viewing experience for users across difference devices. In terms of the functionality of the drag-and-drop, that functionality is currently not suited for touch screens, making it only restricted to certain devices.
                                                    </li><br /><li><b>Maintainability</b><br />
                                                    With the front-end code and back-end code separated, the app can be easily maintained. Also, during the development phase, a lot of emphasis was put in terms of the structure of folders, grouping components and their subcomponents in a subdirectory instead of randomly placing them. This allows future developers to easily locate the relevant files and work on them.
                                                    </li><br /><li><b>Testing</b><br />
                                                    Several unit tests were made for the components and the Node APIs of the app, which proved to be useful to us. We also prepared test cases for how the front-end interacts with the backend. Despite that, with the absence of time, not much testing was done on the entire app as a whole, which could be improved. Also, when testing, we did not consider the usage of mobile devices as an option.
                                                    </li><br /><li><b>Project Management</b><br />
                                                    The team worked well together, with the workload distributed evenly among the team members. Components and roles were assigned according to the strengths of the team members, and we had no issues when integrating our components. In retrospect, we could have given ourselves more time in terms of deployment, as we found out in the final stages of development, that there were some deployment issues while using Electrode. This resulted in us migrating to Next.js after several attempts to contact the dev team of Electrode. Also, the amount of testing of the app could be improved, as time was lost trying to migrate to Next.

                                                Peach is a vast but really interesting project. We all are very to have been part of it. Obiviously, due to the size of the project, a lot of tasks remains before having a fully working prototype. Here is a list of what we would have done with another 6 months:
                                                <br />
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li><b>Build an admin panel:</b> To create and manage meetings, specialities, patients, ... The back-end is already built for that, but front-end still needs to be implemented.</li>
                                                	<li><b>Login/Authentication:</b> Another team was responsible for the login component. They delivered it a bit too late for us to integrate it.</li>
                                                	<li><b>Allow meetings to be recurring(weekly/monthly):</b> This specific behaviour could easily be implemented by modifiying the meeting_occurence table and adding a recurring attribute, but we lack of time and prioritized various functionalities instead.</li>
                                                	<li><b>Improve the testing of the app:</b> We believe that our unit tests is efficient and does job perfectly. However, we didn't implement tests for all of our components, again we prioritized new functionalities.</li>
                                                	<li><b>Continue building the app after openEHR team finishes implementation:</b> We truly built a proof of concept as we used the openEHR API in most of its functionalities. However, some openEHR templates (used to store data) aren't built yet, so we couldn't implement them.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </p>
