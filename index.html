							<p>Currently, the health-care system relies heavily on paper to collect patient data. This is a slow, cumbersome, repetitive and error-prone way of collecting important information. Peach Cancer aims to replace paper records in the NHS. The idea is it that doctors can retrieve and update patient data in one federated system, ensuring that details are never out of date. To meet these requirements, we have built a web app which enables role-based access to patient data, along with other useful features, such as a jobs list and scheduler. </p>

							<p>Our client is the UCLH (University College London Hospital), which implies that our application would significantly help patients and doctor. More specifically, a team called UCL Peach (Platform for Enhanced Analytics and Computational Healthcare), an open source community driven Data Science project by the Computer Science Department at UCL is helping out UCLH in managing this project, with us three students as one of the sub-teams. This application aims to potentially improve the standard procedures of medical registration of the patients, significantly speeding up the process where patient records go through the system. The client’s main representative is <b>Dr. Navin Ramachandran</b>, a dedicated doctor who has a passion towards this project and its success. He has been a great help to us, guiding us through the planning and coding of the project.</p>

						    <h4 class="txt-dark-blue">Problem Statement - What Problem Are We Solving?</h4>
						    <p>Healthcare data is incredibly valuable, important and sensitive.
						        Given these three attributes, it doesn't make sense, in the modern world, for this data to be collected, stored, transported and read-from a physical medium.
						        Clearly there are several issues inherent in the current system.</p>
						    <p>These problems include:</p>
						    <table class="table table-list">
						        <tbody>
						            <tr>
						                <td><i class="fa fa-unlock-alt txt-dark-blue"></i></td>

						            <tr>
						                <td><i class="fa fa-files-o txt-dark-blue"></i></td>
						                <td>Leads to redundant or duplicated data, opening the door to consistency errors</td>
						            </tr>
						            <tr>
						                <td><i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o txt-dark-blue"></i></td>

						    </table>
						    <br>
						    <h4 class="txt-dark-blue">How Does The Peach Project Help?</h4>
						    <p>Many of the issues raised above are solved simply by converting from a physical medium to a digital one.
						        That is where The Peach Project comes in.
						        We are constructing a platform where healthcare professionals can perform all the tasks they do currently, but benefit from doing so digitally.</p>
						    <p>These benefits include:</p>
						    <table class="table table-list">
						        <tbody>
						            <tr>

						                <td><i class="fa fa-database txt-dark-blue"></i></td>

						                <td><i class="fa fa-file txt-dark-blue"></i></td>
						                <td>Pre-existing patient data is used to pre-fill forms, removing the need to transcribe duplicate data</td>
						            </tr>
						            <tr>
						                <td><i class="fa fa-check-square-o txt-dark-blue"></i></td>
						                <td>Form validation prevents entry of obviously incorrect data, leading to higher data quality</td>

                            <p>
                                At the begining of the project, our client us provided us a set of requirements. We misunderstood one (general workflow). Once we truly understood what it was about, we made some research and realized that this requirement could hardly be done within 6 months, considering all the other requirements we had. We talked to our client who has been very comprehensive. Hence, we took this off our requirement and replaced it with others (<a href="#requirements-table">See requirements table</a>).
                            </p>

                                We made three personas representing well our users. A young technology-aware doctor, a middle-age MDT coordinator, and a senior GP. This shows that ease of use is a major criteria for this application, and that portability and reponsiveness really are important.

		 					<p>
							A workflow manager combines the usage of BPMN (Business Process Model Notation) diagrams with the organizing of workflow for the processes, allowing the application to present different medical forms to the user depending on which stage the user is in the process.  Initially, we looked through some open software workflow managers to have a clearer understand of how it functions. Some examples that we looked through were ProcessMaker, Activity and Interstage. At the time, we were considering Node as the web framework for our application, so we found a few node packages that could help with the job. The “bpmn” module allows the illustration of process oriented business logic, which allows tasks to be arranged in a workflow. This would be ideal for Node.js as the interactions in this module is asynchronous, which is a distinct characteristic for Node. Another option that we found was the “wf” module, which is an ongoing open source project. This module also allows the orchestration of processes, allowing the programming of sequences of tasks, in our case, producing forms after an event is triggered or after a task is completed. Even though “wf” is a more specified module compared to “bpmn”, some functions are not specified as it as relatively new compared to “bpmn”. After deeper understanding of what a workflow manager does, and how large the scale of this component, we decided that our sub-team of three people is not sufficient to complete the component in the time given. After discussing this with our client, we decided to remove this component from the list of requirements. But this was still a notable research done, thus being listed here. </p>

							As a team, we investigated several front-end and back-end frameworks before ultimately making the decision to use Electrode. Amongst the front-end frameworks considered were React, Angular, and the back-end servers was Node JS. In the end, in order to standardise the means of coding for every subteam in the Peach Cancer Team, we voted on using Electrode as the main framework. Electrode is a combination of React, Redux and Node, allowing programmers to combine both front-end and back-end source code into a singular directory, making it easier for other programmers to collaborate upon it.  For our sub-team, this would allow us to produce front-end components that would be able to retrieve patients’ data from the OpenEHR database provided by the other sub-teams of the project. Specifics of the research can be found in the Research folder below.<br>

							<b>ReactJS:</b> React is in fact a Javascript library, which allows interactive functions for the user interfaces. React focusses on a modular approach. In other terms, it encourages the reusing of React components across the application. React was initially considered the main front-end framework for our application, as the UCL Peach Cancer teams wanted a modern functional framework across all sub-teams.<br></p>

							<b>AngularJS:</b>

							AngularJS is also a Javascript front-end framework, allowing programmers to use HTML as a template language to express the components more clearly. It introduces data binding, which is a unique way to eliminate excessive code. This framework was investigated as an alternative to React, as the front-end of the application due to the easier management of code.</p>

							<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
								<p><b>Pros of AngularJS:</b>
								<ul>
									<li>Expressive, thus needing less code for the same result compared to other libraries.</li>
									<li>Allows data-binding between the model and the view.</li>
									<li>Good for apps with large amounts of interactive client-side code.</li>
								</ul></p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
								<p>
								<b>Cons:</b>
								<ul>
									<li>Not much documentation, as it’s a relatively new framework</li>
									<li>Router function is limited</li>
									<li>Some Angular are quite complex, takes time to learn</li>

							<img class=" wow fadeIn " src="img/node.png" style="width:100px;">
							<p>
							<b>NodeJS:</b>
							NodeJS is a Javascript runtime which uses event-driven, non-blocking I/O model making it quite unique. This allows Node to be more efficient and lightweight compared to other frameworks. It combines a little of both front-end and back-end functionalities. As a team, we initially had a thought of using a combination of React and Node as the structure for our application. Thus, we researched deeper into what Node can provide to us.
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
									<p><b>Pros of NodeJS:</b></p>
										<ul><li>Well established framework. Documentation are up-to-date and easy to find.</li>
										<li>Server-side and client-side functionalities share the same piece of code</li>
										<li>It’s built to handle concurrent requests due to its asynchronous event drive I/O</li>
									</ul>
								</div>
								<div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
								<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

							<img class=" wow fadeIn " src="img/electrode-logo.svg" style="width:100px;">
							<p><br><b>ElectrodeJS:</b>
							After several weeks of research, we as the UCL Peach Cancer team, decided to use ElectrodeJS as the ultimate framework for the web application. Electrode combines the front-end reusable aspects of React, the concepts of Flux in Redux, and the route management of the web servers of Node into a functional package. It also provides a standard way for us to write our code, clearly differentiating client-side code from the server-side code, allowing easier collaboration between sub-teams as Electrode code is way more readable compared to other available JS libraries. Electrode is well suited for our application, as our application requires lots of interactive code in the client-side, while still being able to retrieve data from an OPENEHR database and route views to the servers. Besides that, it helps us maintain our code, to be accessible by other sub-teams for further improvement. With the advantages of Electrode as shown below, we decided that Electrode was our optimal choice, and we will be using it in the development of the application.
							<br><br><b>Pros of Electrode:</b>
							<ul><li>Reusable code. This allows consistency across the code, allowing the best practices of code to be done.</li>
							<li>Performance. Electrode Caching and Profiling allows SSR (server side rendering) to be supported, enhancing performances of the application.</li>
							<li>Streamlined development cycle. With several technologies and configurations required in each development, Electrode allows these technologies to be streamlined into a single package, allowing developers to focus on building the app instead of working on how to combine these several technologies.</li>
							<li>Powerful tools. Electrode provides several tools which are useful in the development of the application. Electrode Explorer enables the discovery of reusable components, avoiding the writing of excessive repeated code. Electrify and Bundle Analyzer helps optimize Javascript bundles, and can exist independently to the application, making development more convenient.</li></ul>

							<h4 class="txt-dark-blue text-center">Scheduler</h4>

							<p>
							As specified, this scheduler acts as a calendar which allows admins to assign available patients to the weekly-held MDT (Multi Disciplinary Team) meetings. For this, our team found an open-source project of a functional calendar based on React code, which can be configured and reused for our application’s purpose. Our client also specified a drag-and-drop interface, allowing admins to essentially drag patient’s profiles and drop them into the calendar. Through research, we discovered a React library called “react-draggable” which allows elements to be dragged around.
							Jobs List
							The jobs list allow patients to be assigned to doctors at the end of each MDT meeting. The profile of these patients will then appear in the dashboards of the doctor’s homepage. Node.js, being a web server, has several functions that makes this possible. With the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system created by another sub-team, we can specify a MDT coordinator with the task of assigning these patients to the doctors. With some research, we found an open-source Node library named “tasqueue” which allows the creation of users and the assignment of tasks to users, which will largely aid the development of the jobs list.
							Processes
							After our team negotiated with the client, we agreed that creating a workflow manager is not a reasonable task given the time we have. This leaves us the option of hard-coding the workflow, essentially requiring us to research into the current business processes of UCLH.</p>

							<h4 class="txt-dark-blue text-center">Testing</h4>

							<p>
							We needed to find a way to test our app through the development process. After few researches we found a node module named Mocha. Principle is fairly easy: we define unit test, implement them, and make sure our code pass the test. When the app progress, we can run all unit tests a once to verify that everything previously built is still working properly.</p>

    							<br/><b>Electrode.JS -> Next.JS</b><br/>
                                Initially we decided to use ElectrodeJS as the main framework for the application. But in the final stages of development, we found out that as Electrode was a fairly new project, the deployment was fairly unstable. We ran into a few problems while trying to deploy our app to the Azure VMs, and after several attempts to contact the Dev team of Electrode, we decided to look for other alternatives. A few examples of issues, were the retrieving of CSS stylesheets through GET requests, and the long compilation time through “gulp dev”.<br/>

                                </br/>
                                We eventually found Next.JS, a framework which was relatively easy to work with. The framework was well-documentated, and the compilation time for Next is way faster. Also, it easily combines Node and React/Redux, making it our first choice. The process of applying CSS is different, but it became easy after we familiarised ourselves with the framework. The deployment process was also smoother, which prompted us to migrate to Next.

                                <br/>

    							<br/><b>MongoDB -> MySQL</b><br/>
                                Initially we assumed that we needed the specific functions of MongoDB, but after a few weeks of development, we realised that MySQL was sufficient in storing information needed. Also, we were more familiar with the functionalities of MySQL.

                                <br/>
    							<br/><b>Axios and Fetch</b><br/>
                                The use of Axios and Fetch was quite crucial in running asynchronous actions to retrieve data from our database and the OpenEHR database. These Javascript libraries focus on encapsulating HTTP methods for requests as promises, allowing us to do sequential actions after the data is retrieved.

                                <br/>
    							<br/><b>React-select</b><br/>
                                When creating the referral form among other components, the ‘react-select’ library was useful in creating the drop-down selection required to search for patients in the database. This library was chosen as it is created by the React framework, which makes it compatible with the rest of our components.

                                <br/>

                                In the end, we used NextJS as the deployment process is smoother. MySQL was used as we didn’t need the specific functions of MongoDB like we initially thought we did. Finally, we used some external packages and libraries to achieve some functionalities in the application and perform some testing on the application.

                                Another sub-team in the PEACH project is responsible for the UI. They will provide us design guidelines, but also react components ready to use and integrate. However, we still have to build our specific component, such as the calendar, and decide ourselves the content organization of the sub-app we are building. Therefore, the team also designed some mock-ups in order to have a better understanding of the needs. <br>

                            <p>At first, our client wanted us to code a worflow manager. We looked into it and tried to search useful ressources to make it. Unfortunately, we realize that it was a very complicated task, so we are simply going to hardcode the worflow of the app instead. The following mockup was done to represent the interface of the workflow manager.</p>

                            Before the actual implementations of the app, we had to do severals iterations of mock-ups and wireframes. For each iterration, we were sending our mockups to our client directly over ryver. Thanks to this, we were able to get feedback really quickly. We even collaborated with our client using google docs. Here is an extract of each of the iterrations.

                        <h3 class="text-center txt-dark-blue title">HCI PRINCIPLES</h3>

                        <p>
                            While developing the app, we modified some components several times to follow the HCI principles, which makes it accessible to the potential users of the app.
                            <br/><br/><b>Visibility</b><br/>
                            The appearance of the app was made as simplistic as possible. We changed the location of the navigation bar initially from the top to the left, and made it significantly bigger, so that users can easily see the different available tabs.
                            <br/><br/><b>Affordance</b><br/>
                            We made several UI changes to make it obvious for users to understand how to use our app. Some components have basic instructions to make it obvious for users to use it. This includes the drag-and-drop scheduler, and the select form used to search for patients in the database.
                            <br/><br/><b>Feedback</b><br/>
                            Some components made notifications whenever an action is done. For example, using ‘react-notify-toast’, a notification pops up telling the user that the referral form has been submitted. Also, a spinner can be seen when the scheduler tries to load up the patients from the database.
                            <br/><br/><b>Consistency</b><br/>
                            The appearance of the app was hugely influenced by this principle. We decided to use React bootstrap to model our app so that it remains similar to other websites that people would regularly use. Certain bootstrap icons were also used consistently throughout the app to imply the same function. Besides that, the basic design and fonts of the overall app follows the design guide set by the Peach team, making every page consistent to each other.
                            <br/><br/><b>Mapping</b><br/>
                            The sidebar was changed several times. In the current version, the words in the selected tab on the sidebar turns yellow. This allows the user to know which section they are currently in.
                            <br/><br/><b>Constraints</b><br/>
                            Some constraints were implemented in terms of user types. For instance, the referral form can only be submitted when a user is logged in as an admin. This prevents users who have not logged in from accessing the functionalities of the app.
                        </p>

                                        <p>We designed a simple todo-list app to learn how to use node and its different modules. We used express (a node must-have), body parser (to fetch data transmitted via forms), and cookie-session to store user's todo list. The first thing done was to add tasks to users' session. The goal here was to get familiar with node, express framework, routing, and to experiments with forms.</p>

                                        <p>We believe that this small app helped us learn more about this technology. These experiments can be really useful for all of our requirements. Indeed, it involves basic but essential things such as forms handling or routing.</p>

We found a react library named React DnD (for drag&drop). With it, we built a very basic version of the patient drag and drop to agenda. As a first step, we made the patient move from one day to other simply by clicking the desired day.</p>

                                        <p>Redux involves holding all state associated with an application is one single global object. Importantly, this object is immutable. In order to respond to a user interaction, we emit an action, for example ADD JOB. That action has a particular ID and potentially a payload containing data. For ADD JOB that data would be the title of the new job. This action is passed to  a reducer which is responsible for taking the current state, along with the action, and returning a new state object which has been changed in such a way so that the action has an effect. For ADD JOB that would be adding the specified job to the state.</p>
                                        <p><b>Result:</b></p>
                                        <p>By implementing redux we have found that having all state in a single JavaScript object has certain advantages. For one, that object can be stored in local storage in the browser, meaning that the user’s application loads quickly upon return. Additionally, it’s forced us to adopt an explicit coding style when it comes to actions. Since all actions available in the application are defined in a single file, it is quick to check what functionality is available and this can prevent us writing functionally similar code.</p>

                                At the onset of the project we were keen to use a React framework to unify and promote consistency across the multiple development teams working on PEACH. To this end we selected Electrode, from WalmartLabs. Electrode is a universal React platform with support for universal javascript and server side rendering of react components.
                                <br />    <br />
                                However, we encountered several issues with the framework, including strange bugs which prevented bundles from generating and difficulties deploying to Azure. Alongside this the framework called for a huge number of dependencies, resulting in  bloated bundle sizes and the Electrode team were slow to respond to issues raised on GibHub and eventually stopped responding. Because there wasn't much documentation available and it seemed pretty unstable, we decided it was time to drop Electrode too. However, we wanted to keep using a framework because we did not want to have to re-invent the wheel for problems that frameworks had already fixed (e.g. SSR / HTML caching).
                                    <br />    <br />
                                After researching we decided to use a relatively new framework called Next.js, from Zeit. Version 2.0 had just been released and after hearing excellent reviews (alongside an impressive 12,000 stars on GitHub) we decided to commit to switching. Next uses react as well, but is only a front-end framework, so a lot of work was required to move from electrode to Next. We had to refactor all our components because the css rendering was totally different, and we had to separate back-end and front-end. So we created another node app that uses express.js to build our own API.
                                    <br />    <br />

                            <br /><br /><b>Front-End main components:</b><br />
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                </li><li><b>Referral</b><br />
                            This allows users to create referral forms for patients, so that they will be discussed in MDT meetings. Users will be able to search through patients or create new patients, and when the form is submitted, the information about the patient would be then sent to the OpenEHR database.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Case Preparation</b><br />
                            This component allows doctors to search for patients and add notes about them prior to an MDT meeting. Currently, the notes are fixed as the endpoint for this has not been set up in the OpenEHR by the Peach team.
                            </li><li><b>Confirmation</b><br />
                            This page allows patients to be assigned to doctors after an MDT meeting is complete. This job would then show up in the JobsList page. Furthermore, doctors would be able to see the notes that were made during the meetings, and add on notes of their own after the meeting. Currently, this feature is unavailable as the endpoint for gathering notes from meetings has not been provided to us.
                                </li><li><b>JobsList</b><br />
                            The jobs list displays all the jobs that were assigned to each doctor after the MDT meeting is complete. This list allows users to look through their active jobs, and delete the ones that they have completed.
                                </li><li><b>Scheduler</b><br />
                            This component allows users to assign patients to meetings via drag-and-drop. It retrieves the information of patients from the OpenEHR database after a referral has been made for the patient. By assigning the patients or removing them from the meetings, the database on the server would then update accordingly. Users will also be able to find out more about the meetings and the patients that are currently assigned in the respective meetings.

                                <ul><li>
                                The back-end uses express, a node.js lightweight framework. Express is used for routes, and request are distributed among different objects (one for each table) that are responsible for mysql queries. All the our objects have at least the 4 CRUD (create, read, updatea nd delete) methods and more if needed. In total, there are 37 endpoints!

                        <h3 class="text-center txt-dark-blue title">DESIGN PATTERN</h3>
                        <p>
                            Throughout the development of this application, a lot of design patterns were used to provide simpler and better solutions to the problems we had.
                            <br/><br/><b>State</b><br/>
                            With react and redux as the main front-end framework, we used “states” in React and “stores” in Redux to encapsulate the internal states of the application. This was really helpful as certain components have to behave according to the current internal states. For example, a “user-type” class was created to model the various types of users like, Admin and Normal User. This would then decide if the referral form could be submitted or not, as it only works if the user is signed in as an admin.
                            <br/><br/><b>Iterator</b><br/>
                            The iterator pattern was used constantly as many arrays were used to store values and variables. This allowed us to run methods and operations on all the elements while traversing through the array. The use of axios.all() in the Scheduler component helped provide an array of GET requests, then iterate through the array to run all the GET requests simultaneously and getting the required data for the patients.
                            <br/><br/><b>Singleton</b><br/>
                            This application relies a lot on storing information. Instead of having multiple databases each storing values of their respective components, we have a singular database which handles all the information coming and going out from the application. This fulfils the singleton property as it makes managing data transfer easier, which helps the development of the app significantly.
                            <br/><br/><b>Façade</b><br/>
                            The idea of using this design pattern is inherited by the use of React and Redux as the front-end framework. React and Redux relies on components encapsulating other smaller components, which makes the final integration and routing of the application easy, as only the main “Parent” class is required for the routing process. For example, the “Jobs List” component consists of an entire subsystem of components and classes required for it to work, but we only need the “Jobs List” component file location to route it with the entire application.
                            <br/><br/><b>Mediator</b><br/>
                            While creating a database-centralised application, this design pattern was crucial to our development. The use of NodeJS, MySQL and Express for the server side, combined with Axios and Fetch for the client side to provide API calls to the database made sure that changes on the front-end would be registered at the backend. This allows constant communication between the database and the front-end, ensuring data are in sync with each other.
                            <br/><br/><b>Bridge</b><br/>
                            This pattern is consistently used as Redux was one of the frameworks for the app. Redux utilises “Stores”, “Reducers” and “Actions” to separate the implementation of the components from the interface, which is stored as “Container” components. This separates the appearance of the components from the actual behavioural code, making it easy to single out bugs during development.

                        <p>
                            As discussed before, we use the openEHR API to store confidential information. Our own database is used for to store functional data, such as patient assignments to meetings. Here is the database structure:
                            <br />
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
                                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/database-structure.png" />
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </p>

                        <br />
                        <h3 class="text-center txt-dark-blue title">Development tools</h3>
                        <br />
                        <p>As our team is part of a bigger team, there are tools that we are required to use. For the PEACH global team, we use Ryver to communicate among teams, as it allows to have full history of messages (Slack doesn't provide this feature for free). History of messages is crucial as the project will most likely be carried forward to students next year for further progress. Also, Ryver acts as a platform for more experienced people to guide us through the process, offering us help whenever we needed it. For our source code, we used GitLab to create private repositories. This is very useful to check other sub-teams' code, as all of our work are depending on each other. Besides that, a Google Drive directory was set up for us by the client to share information and files regarding the application, for example the standard procedures of the registration of a patient, and the specifications and requirements of the application.
						<br><br>
						 Internally to the team, we focussed on using Github as a repository to store our source code and record our progress. This prompted us to set up our private Git to store information regarding the website, and the progress of our components. Facebook Messenger is our main way of communication. We also set up a Google Drive to store files or information regarding the project such as notes and bi-weekly reports. For coding, our main tools are text editors (Atom, Sublime Text, and Microsoft Visual Studio), and react developer tools.

                                    <br />We can then perform simple conditional checks upon the user’s role to determine application access.

                                    <b>Jobs List:</b><br />
                                    The jobs list is simple in conception, but utilises some cool techniques to provide a responsive UX.
                                    The jobs list is made up of two key parts, the List component and the Job component. The List is responsible for data fetching, whilst the Job component is concerned only with styling.
                                    <br />
                                    The List component performs an initial API request to get an array of jobs. It adds this array to the Redux store and maps over that array to produce an array of Job components, each passed the details for an individual job. That list of Job components is then rendered to the DOM.
                                    <br />
                                    To create a responsive UX when the user clicks the delete button,
                                    we store a loadingJob field in redux. This field specifies which, if any, job is undergoing some work. We can then use that data to change the visual style of a Job to instantly respond to the user and indicate that the system is working.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    <div class="row">
                                        <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
                                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/job-delete.gif" />
                                        </div>
                                    </div>
                                    <br />
                                    A similar technique is used when the user clicks the refresh button. We simply set the loading field to true, and hook up the refresh button and all Jobs components to enter the loading state when loading is true.

                            During first term our researchs led us to Mocha.js for testing. However, after we started to actually build the application, we found out that using more specific tests tools was easier and more efficient.

                            </br/><b>Front-end</b><br/>
                            We are using Jest to power our test suite. Jest is a testing framework developed at Facebook. We chose Jest because of its zero-configuration setup and powerful features like parallel testing and automatic code coverage reporting. Additionally, Jest uses AirBnb’s testing library, Enzyme, behind the scenes which allows for a simple and highly readable syntax. Below is an example of a unit test running.

                            We are using Frisby.js to power our api test suite. Frisby.js is a testing framework specially designed to test endpoints. It is very easy to ease, and to define several test expectations such as: the response, the response header, the response status. The only problem we had was that frisby doesnt natively support modern http request such as delete or put. We had to modify our API and allow X-HTTP-Method-Override headers, so that olders and forms can still use our restful API.<br /><br />
                            <div class="row">

                        <p>
                            For each version of the app, alongside our own testing, we also performed user testing by sending the application to our client for review. Ryver was a really useful tool for this. Without having to meet our client, we could get feeback in less than a day, and apply changes really quickly. This additional layer of testing was particularly good at capturing UX problems.
                            <br />
                            For the restful API we used Postman. It allowed us to test our 37 endpoints! This was really useful while developing the front-end components. We created a Postman collection which is easily exportable, that we did put in our repository.

                        <p>
                            We performed compatibility testing to check that the application functioned properly across browsers and devices (excluding mobile). For instance, it was during one of these tests that we discovered that the login dropdown did not work in Firefox. This led us to research the issue and add additional CSS to combat this browser specific bug.

                        <p>
                            Our responsive design testing was focussed on ensuring the application performs well across various devices. Whilst we are not targeting mobile in this project, we still want to check the application is usable on tablets and touch enabled computers. This form of testing let us to remove several UX interactions which relied on mouse hover events to work. By replacing these with click/tap events we found that usability increased across all devices without a significant drop in UX.

                        <p>
                            Next.js is a slim framework, and we noticed a ~75% reduction in the size of our node_modules folder. Next.js performs automatic bundle splitting, using the file-system as the API, meaning that the home page only downloads the JavaScript required to run that page. Other pages are then either prefetched in the background or requested dynamically. When coupled with SSR, we saw a very snappy response time. (On Regular 3G with a 5x CPU slowdown the time to first paint was for Next.js was 1.72s vs Electrode’s 2.8s).
                            <br /><br />
                            Frisby.js which we use for back-end application testing is also configured to expect define response time. Therefore, if for some reasons the api was significantly slowed down, we would be notified.

                            Another peach team was responsible for the user authentification. They delivered the component late, and we couldn't integrate it. However, we used react redux to simulate some users, and use these users to limit the access to the different pages of our app. The access to openEHR API is also restricted, and everytime a user connect to our app, he is automatically connected to the openEHR API. This allows our user to request and post confidential information on EHR.
